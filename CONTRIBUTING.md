# Contributing to Documentation
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a typo
* Discussing the current state of the documentation
* Suggestions on improvements
* Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use Github to host the documentation, track issues, and accept pull requests.

## All documentation changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the documentation. We actively welcome your pull requests:

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License
In short, when you submit documentation changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/chaqmoq/docs/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report typos or suggestions using Github's [issues](https://github.com/chaqmoq/docs/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track typos and suggestions on how to improve the documentation. Report a typo or suggestion by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chaqmoq/docs/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
Please, read [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material) before you contribute.
